										<h1>About me</h1>
									</header>
									<p>I’m a data enthusiast with a passion for solving real-world problems through data science and analytics. My journey started with a Master’s in Information and Data Science from UC Berkeley, where I honed my skills in machine learning, big data processing, and data visualization. What drives me is the ability to turn complex datasets into meaningful insights that can shape decisions and make an impact.</p>
									<p>I’ve had the privilege of working as an Assistant Vice President in US Cyber Internal Audit at Barclays, where I combined my love for data with the need for strong cybersecurity measures. One of my key projects involved automating testing workflows to identify and close security gaps, ensuring that data leakage controls were robust and compliant. Utilizing webscraping techniques and process mining, I extracted issue activity history from JIRA and found workflows where changes were put into production without adaquate testing. I also developed SQL queries to validate user access across multiple systems, helping prevent unauthorized access and ensuring that role-based access controls were enforced. One of the things I’m proudest of is using data to reveal hidden insights—whether it's improving asset management through Python scripts or automating workflows to save time and reduce errors.</p>
									<p>Outside of cybersecurity, I’ve worked on some exciting projects. I’ve predicted flight delays with machine learning, explored arbitrage opportunities in cryptocurrency markets, and even mapped the best locations for renewable energy installations using geographic visualizations. I’m comfortable with a range of tools like Python, Spark, TensorFlow, and Tableau, and I love diving into new technologies that can help solve complex challenges.</p>
									<p>Now, I’m looking for opportunities to bring my skills in data science and analytics to new challenges. I thrive in environments where I can apply both my technical skills and my curiosity to create solutions that make a real difference. Whether it’s through predictive modeling, process optimization, or deep analysis, I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute and learn in a dynamic, data-driven role.</p>
